<h1>Our Story</h1>

<p>The Kids Toy Hive first started as a thought that came from a need for more possibilities that would keep my 18 month old daughter busy. I would watch my daughter play with her toys and after a few weeks, she would get bored with playing with the same ole (new) toys. I didn’t think much about it until one day it hit me. What if there was some way I could have new toys for her to play with without having to purchase new toys all the time and then having to find a way to scrap the old ones without wasting or losing money. She would always have new toys and would never get bored! I did some research and found that there wasn’t any options or services like that around so, I decided to take on the task.</p>

<p>I know that there are many parents who would love the idea of having the ability to change toys every now and again without the expense of buying or wasting money on toys that won’t even be used the next day. I know that can be a real bummer. So here we are, giving parents, such as myself, an opportunity to keep your child busy with lots of activity in an affordable way!</p>

<p>We are starting with phase 1 which will consist of renting toys that you may not purchase under normal circumstances but it would be a good option for kids birthday parties or maybe you just want to keep them busy for the day. Whatever your reason, we want to make your experience easy and not cheesy, and fun, for everyone.</p>
